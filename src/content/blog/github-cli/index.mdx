# GitHub CLI: The Complete Guide to Using GitHub from Your Terminal

In modern software development, we spend a lot of time on GitHub: creating repositories, managing pull requests, reviewing code, handling issues…

But what if you could do all of that **without opening your browser**?

In this article, we’ll explore **GitHub CLI**, the official tool that lets you interact with GitHub directly from your terminal.

---

## 🚀 What is GitHub CLI?

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (command: `gh`) is GitHub’s official command-line tool.

It allows you to:

- Create and manage repositories  
- Open and manage Pull Requests  
- Create and assign Issues  
- Trigger GitHub Actions workflows  
- Automate development tasks  

👉 In short: **you control GitHub without leaving your terminal.**

## 💻 Installation

### Windows 

```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

### linux

The command can depend on your linux distribution

```bash
sudo apt install gh
```


## 🔐 Authentication

Once installed, run:

```bash
gh auth login
```

You’ll be guided to:

- Choose GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise

- Authenticate via browser or token

- Select your preferred protocol (HTTPS or SSH)

After this step, your terminal is connected to your GitHub account.

## 📁 Essential Commands

### 1️⃣ Create a Repository

```bash
gh repo create my-project
```

Useful options:

```bash
gh repo create my-project --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

This will:

- Create the repository on GitHub

- Link it to your local folder

- Automatically push your code

### 2️⃣ Clone a Repository

```bash
gh repo clone username/repository
``` 

### 3️⃣ Create a Pull Request

```bash
gh pr create
```

The interactive assistant will ask for:

- The base branch
- The title
- The description

You can also automate it:

```bash
gh pr create --title "New Feature" --body "Adds the new feature implementation"
```

### 4️⃣ List Pull Requests

```bash
gh pr list
```

### 5️⃣ Create an Issue

```bash
gh issue create
```

You can also specify details directly:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Bug in login flow" --body "Error occurs when submitting the form"
```

## 🔄 Practical Workflow Example

Here’s a simple real-world workflow using GitHub CLI:

- Initialize your local project

- Create a repository:

```bash
gh repo create my-app --public --source=. --push
```

- Create a new branch and implement a feature

- Push your branch:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

- Open a Pull Request:

```bash
gh pr create
```

- Merge the PR:

```bash
gh pr merge
```

All without opening GitHub in your browser.
